# API Part
Still Under Construction.

This project is going to b a Reddit clone. It is separated in two parts, one that contains the API and one that contains the UI. You can find the other part right here https://github.com/Em-Gkoulias/reddit_clone_frontend.

This is the API part. It is made using ExpressJs. I have used bcryptjs in order to encrypt users passwords during registration and login. I have also used JWT in order to transmit information between my API and and my UI, which I stored inside a cookie. I choosed to use PostgreSQL as my database and the multer module in order to be able to upload images.
